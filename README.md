## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to build a chatbot tailored for trading-related tasks. The chatbot is designed to handle various trading queries, providing relevant information and responses. The Streamlit app offers an interactive interface for users, while the Jupyter notebook details the development and fine-tuning of the chatbot model using the Ollama framework and Microsoft's PHI-3 model.

## Requirements

To run the chatbot and the app, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Jupyter Notebook
- Ollama
- PyTorch

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/imanoop7/trading-chatbot.git
    cd trading-chatbot
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

### Streamlit App
To run the Streamlit app, execute the following command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

This will launch the Streamlit interface in your default web browser. You can interact with the chatbot through this interface.

## Jupyter Notebook
1. Open the Jupyter notebook to develop and fine-tune the chatbot model:
Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook

2. Open bot.ipynb in your browser.

3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to load the datasets, configure the model, and train the 
   chatbot using the Ollama framework and Microsoft's PHI-3 model.
